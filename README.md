Disinformation are spreading like wildfire in Europe, for political or commercial manipulation, hampering efforts to contain the pandemic, and ripping apart our society’s social fabric. Lives literally depend on all of us listening to health authorities and our ability to access, rely and trust reliable information. Yet more and more European citizens find themselves unable to do so.\
\
Many technical approaches against the spread of fake news either rely entirely on human fact-checks or entirely on AI. We want to combine the accuracy and pluralism of fact-checks from trusted journalists with the scalability machine based validation.\
\
We also see this as an opportunity to showcase the excellent work already done by fact-checkers and to raise citizens' awareness of the importance of media pluralism and the unprecedented existential challenge COVID represents for the news sector.\
\
We will leverage our existing contacts to partner with fact-checkers, traditional media, European civil society and policymakers for our product dissemination and continuous improvement. We are also committed to transparency and a human rights-based approach – including with regards to the recognition of the intrinsic limitations of the technology that we offer.\
